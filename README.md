		ColdFusion ePub Generation
	</h1>
	
	<p>
		When I was doing some research about ePub books, I discovered that they
		were nothing more than a compiled set of XHTML files and images. When I
		learned this, I immediately thought to myself, "This can toooootally be
		done in ColdFusion." And so, it took me a few hours to put together, but
		this is the first pass at what I came up with.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This project is a set of ColdFusion custom tags that create a layer of
		abstraction above a set of ColdFusion components that allow the programmer
		to easily generate ePub electronic books using standard XHTML and images.
