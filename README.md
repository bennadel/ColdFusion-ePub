ColdFusion ePub Generation
==========================

When I was doing some research about ePub books, I discovered that they were nothing more than a compiled set of XHTML files and images. When I learned this, I immediately thought to myself, "This can toooootally be done in ColdFusion." And so, it took me a few hours to put together, but this is the first pass at what I came up with.

This project is a set of ColdFusion custom tags that create a layer of abstraction above a set of ColdFusion components that allow the programmer to easily generate ePub electronic books using standard XHTML and images.
